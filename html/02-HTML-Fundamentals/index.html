            All modern websites and web applications are built using three <i>fundamental</i> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the<em> web.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
        </p>
        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag
                
                </li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can learn more at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a>.</p>
        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language    
               </li>
            <li> To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
            <li> To build web applications</li>
            <li> To impress friends</li>
            <li> To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
        </ul>
